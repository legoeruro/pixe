# pixelevo
 
An app that simulates "evolution" but not really. In the beginning, each pixel is generated randomly. \
Each generation, within a group of 25 pixels the 12 pixels most closely related to img.jpg will evolve closer to match the pixels in img.jpg; the rest will be "killed" (randomly generated again).\
Change the img.jpg file to change the image loaded.
